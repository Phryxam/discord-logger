# discordLoggerBot
A bot I made for logging the contents of Discord servers

## Dependencies
Old version of Discord.py (Requires that you're on Python <3.4)
	Can be installed with:
		python -m pip install discord

Usage:
	Run logger.py, input your Discord credentials or a bot token.
	The bot will then go ahead and log every channel of every server that it is in.
	It will also attempt to log voice channels or categories, but they will show up as empty.
